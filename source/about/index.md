My name is Jie Chi (池洁), and I recently completed my PhD at the University of Edinburgh. I was part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Natural Language Processing](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing), supervised by Peter Bell and co-supervised by Catherine Lai. My PhD research focused on multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition, particularly in code-switching settings.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and a Master's degree in Computer Science. Before my PhD, I worked as a researcher at iFlytek for about a year, specializing in ASR. During my PhD, I completed a two-month remote internship at NeuralSpace and later interned at Apple in their Copenhagen office.

While my research has primarily focused on speech, I have a strong interest in NLP in general. Feel free to get in touch if you're interested in my work!
