My name is Jie Chi (池洁), and I am currently in my final year of my PhD program at the University of Edinburgh. I am part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Natural Language Processing](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing), supervised by Peter Bell and co-supervised by Catherine Lai. I am now in the theis writing phase, with plans to submit it by August. My PhD research is about multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition, with a particular focus on code-switching settings.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and a Master’s degree in Computer Science. Before my PhD, I spent about one year at iFlytek as a researcher focusing on ASR. During my PhD, I worked remotely as an intern at NeuralSpace for two months. Currently, I am interning at Apple in their Copenhagen office.

Although my research may seem purely focused on speech, I am genuinely interested in NLP in general. Please get in touch if you are interested in my work.
